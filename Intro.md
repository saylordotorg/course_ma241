This course is designed to introduce you to the rigorous examination of
the real number system and the foundations of calculus of functions of a
single real variable. Analysis lies at the heart of the trinity of
higher mathematics – algebra, analysis, and topology – because it is
where the other two fields meet. In calculus, you learned to find
limits, and you used these limits to give a rigorous justification for
ideas of rate of change and areas under curves. Many of the results that
you learned or derived were intuitive – in many cases you could draw a
picture of the situation and immediately “see” whether or not the result
was true. This intuition, however, can sometimes be misleading. In the
first place, your ability to find limits of real-valued functions on the
real line was based on certain properties of the underlying field on
which undergraduate calculus is founded: the real numbers. Things may
have become slightly more complicated when you began to work in other
spaces. For instance, you may remember from multivariable calculus
(calculus in three or more real variables) that for some functions there
were points where some directional derivatives existed and others did
not. In fact, there exist other more exotic spaces where other
complications arise. In the second place, the *techniques* that you used
to find limits may have been very informal. In this course, you will
learn to rigorously justify every step in the limiting process or proof.
Learning to do this well in the familiar context of the real line, will
prepare you for wilder, more complicated mathematical situations. After
a brief review of set theory, you will dive into the analysis of
sequences, upon which all analysis of Euclidean space (and any separable
metric space) is based.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA241: Real Analysis I. General information about this course
and its requirements can be found below. In many ways, this course is
the true gateway into the mathematics major, requiring rigorous proofs,
introducing important topological concepts, and laying the groundwork
for most of the remaining courses you will take as a math major. The
precise mathematical definitions introduced in this course are used by
many fields at the graduate level, including Economics, Physics, and
Electrical Engineering. As you progress through the material, stop to
reflect on each theorem or definition. Look for its motivation behind
the introduction of each new concept – remember, these definitions were
written by people who wished to use them for a purpose! – and try to
work through each proof. Mathematics is not a spectator sport! Taking
care at this time to understand the material deeply will pay dividends
throughout your study of mathematics.

 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   University of Windsor: Elias Zakon’s *[Mathematical Analysis
    I](http://www.trillia.com/zakon-analysisI.html)*
-   University of California, San Diego: Jiri Lebl’s *[Basic Analysis:
    Introduction to Real
    Analysis](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/MA241-BasicAnalysis-JiriLebl-6.3.2013.pdf)*
-   YouTube: Harvey Mudd College: Professor Francis Su’s *[Real
    Analysis](http://www.youtube.com/user/HarveyMuddCollegeEDU#p/u/0/sqEyWLGvvdw)*

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned
materials.   
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **135
hours** to complete. At the beginning of each unit, there is a detailed
list of time advisories for each subunit. These estimates factor in the
time required to watch each lecture, work through each reading
thoughtfully, and complete each assignment. However, this is a very
intense course, and it may take some learners much more time than
others. Do not be discouraged if you exceed the time estimates! As long
as you are gaining mastery of the material, you are completing the
course successfully.
