**Unit 4: Differentiability and Integration** <span id="4"></span> 
*In Calculus you learned the limit definition of the derivative and
connected it to a picture of a sequence of secant lines converging to a
tangent line. Similarly, you learned how the integral is really the
limit of a series of Riemann Sums. In this unit, you will go through the
derivations of those concepts in more detail and with more regard for
the technicalities. You will connect the derivative and the integral to
what you have learned about sequences and series, and you will learn
necessary and sufficient conditions for the exchange of limits. Much of
this does in fact have important implications for numerical integration
and differentiation, so it is important to understand the meaning of
each of the conditions in theorems such as the Weierstrass M-Test.*

     In this lecture, Professor Schinazi discusses the convergence or
    lack thereof of the derivatives of a sequence of functions. (In
    Lecture 14, not required by this course, he discussed the
    convergence of the integrals of a uniformly convergent sequence of
    functions.) He then introduces series of functions and proves the
    Weierstrass M-Test, which is the most important result in this
    lecture. You need not watch the section on the Weierstrass
    Approximation Theorem, although it is very interesting.

     In this lecture, Professor Schinazi discusses power series and
    justifies the various convergence tests (such as the root test and
    the ratio test). In the second half (which is optional), he proves a
    result about the derivative of the pointwise limit of a sequence of
    differentiable functions. He later discusses term-by-term
    differentiation (which is really an interchange of limits).
