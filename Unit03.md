**Unit 3: Functions and Continuity** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will explore the properties of continuous functions.
You should be familiar with continuity from calculus; indeed, many of
the results which are proven in this unit will be familiar, such as the
intermediate value theorem or the fact that the sum of two continuous
functions is continuous. However, you will now be proving these results
rigorously and with more generality. You will also be learning new
concepts, such as uniform continuity, and you will be improving your
knowledge of what might be called “mathematical culture” through
exposure to famous and much-employed examples, such as the Dirichlet
function and the Cantor Ternary set. Learn these examples well; they are
used in many cases as counterexamples. Be sure also to note the use of
the Triangle Inequality in the proof that the uniform limit of a
sequence of continuous functions is itself continuous. This is a
standard and well-known technique.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   define continuity;
-   state, prove, and use properties of limits of continuous functions;
-   state and use properties of rational functions;
-   define divergence of functions to infinity and use properties of
    infinite limits;
-   define monotonicity;
-   prove that continuous functions attain extreme values on compact
    sets;
-   state and prove the intermediate value property;
-   define uniform continuity and show that given functions are or are
    not uniformly continuous;
-   give standard examples of discontinuous functions, such as the
    Dirichlet function;
-   prove that monotone functions have only a finite number of
    discontinuities;
-   define connectedness, and identify connected and disconnected sets;

     Instructions: Please watch the entire video. In this lecture,
    Professor Su defines limits and limit points of functions. He
    defines continuity of a function using neighborhoods and using the
    sequential criterion. He states several properties of continuous
    functions, including the fact that the inverse image of an open set
    (under a continuous function) is open.

     Instructions: Please watch this lecture, in which Professor Su
    discusses the definition of continuity at a point. He proves that

    and illustrates this fact with several examples. He proves that the
    composition of continuous functions is continuous. Finally, he
    proves that the forward image of a compact set under a continuous
    function is compact and mentions some important corollaries for
    real-valued functions. This lecture will cover topics you have

    and what it means for them to converge either pointwise or
    uniformly. He gives several classic examples of sequences of
    functions which converge pointwise to zero. He proves that if a
    sequence of continuous functions converge uniformly, their limit is
    continuous.
