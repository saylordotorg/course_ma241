**Unit 1: The Real Number System** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn or be reminded of the tools of set theory,
which underlie rigorous mathematical proof, before investigating the
real numbers as a field. Beginning with the rational numbers, we will
construct the real number system, a project which took mathematicians
hundreds of years to fully justify. Along the way, we will encounter
several fundamental concepts, including the well-ordering principle, the
completeness axiom, and the Archimedean property.*  
  
 *We will see the proof of the existence of irrational numbers and learn
how to use proof by induction. Finally, we will see proven a number of
results about the cardinality of sets.*

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please read Section 7, “Integers and Rationals,” on
    pages 34-36. Note: The reading for this section focuses on integers
    and rationals, but one cannot ponder the rational numbers without
    considering the existence of irrationals. Hence, in the video
    lectures for this section, the existence of irrationals will be
    proven. The readings on the irrational numbers come in subunit 1.4
    after a few more concepts have been developed. This difference in
    ordering should not interfere with your understanding of the
    lectures for this section.

    to introduce important concepts such as ordering. He proves the
    existence of irrationals, such as the square root of 2. In the
    second lecture, Professor Su discusses Dedekind cuts, the least
    upper bound property of the reals (a.k.a. the completeness
    property). Feel free to end the lecture at 42:00 (the discussion of
    Dedekind cuts).

     Instructions: Please watch this video. Please note that this
    material covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.
    In this lecture, Professor Su further discusses Dedekind cuts and
    the existence of arbitrary real powers of rationals. He goes through
    the least upper bound property of the reals (a.k.a. the completeness
    property), the greatest lower bound property, and the Archimedean
    Property, which he proves. He proves the density of the rationals in
    the real line. He also gives properties of the supremum. Mastery of
    these topics is essential to developing a thorough understanding of
    analysis.

    revisits functions and relations between sets and important concepts
    such as “one-to-one/injective,” “onto/surjective,” and “bijective.”
    He defines finite, infinite, countable, and uncountable sets and
    power sets, and he discusses the cardinality of certain important
    sets. In “Lecture 8: Cantor Diagonalization and Metric Spaces,”
    Professor Su discusses cardinality and Cantor’s diagonalization
